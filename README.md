# Building-a-metrics-dashboard.
In this project, I created the dashboards that use multiple graphs to monitor our sample application that is deployed on a Kubernetes cluster. I used Prometheus, Jaeger, and Grafana in order to monitor, trace and visualize my experience.

## Main Steps :
1. Deploy the sample application in your Kubernetes cluster.
2. Use Prometheus to monitor the various metrics of the application.
3. Use Jaeger to perform traces on the application.
4. Use Grafana in order to visualize these metrics in a series of graphs that can be shared with other members on your team.
5. Document your project in a README.
