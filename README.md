# Building a metrics dashboard
In this project, I created the dashboards that use multiple graphs to monitor our sample application that is deployed on a Kubernetes cluster. I used Prometheus, Jaeger, and Grafana in order to monitor, trace and visualize my experience.

## Main Steps :
1. Deploy the sample application in your Kubernetes cluster.
2. Use Prometheus to monitor the various metrics of the application.
3. Use Jaeger to perform traces on the application.
4. Use Grafana in order to visualize these metrics in a series of graphs that can be shared with other members on your team.
5. Document your project in a README.

## Installation Steps : 
```
curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3
chmod 700 get_helm.sh
./get_helm.sh

kubectl create namespace monitoring
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo add stable https://charts.helm.sh/stable
helm repo update
helm install prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack --namespace monitoring --kubeconfig /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml

kubectl create namespace observability
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-operator/master/deploy/crds/jaegertracing.io_jaegers_crd.yaml
kubectl create -n observability -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-operator/master/deploy/service_account.yaml
kubectl create -n observability -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-operator/master/deploy/role.yaml
kubectl create -n observability -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-operator/master/deploy/role_binding.yaml
kubectl create -n observability -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-operator/master/deploy/operator.yaml

kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-operator/master/deploy/cluster_role_binding.yaml

helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm install mongodb --set auth.rootPassword=password,auth.username=srishti,auth.password=password7,auth.database=example-mongodb bitnami/mongodb --kubeconfig /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml
```

**Note:** All the screenshots are stored in the `answer-img` directory.

## Verify the monitoring installation

*TODO:* run `kubectl` command to show the running pods and services for all components. Take a screenshot of the output and include it here to verify the installation

## Setup the Jaeger and Prometheus source
*TODO:* Expose Grafana to the internet and then setup Prometheus as a data source. Provide a screenshot of the home page after logging into Grafana.

## Create a Basic Dashboard
*TODO:* Create a dashboard in Grafana that shows Prometheus as a source. Take a screenshot and include it here.

## Describe SLO/SLI
*TODO:* Describe, in your own words, what the SLIs are, based on an SLO of *monthly uptime* and *request response time*.

## Creating SLI metrics.
*TODO:* It is important to know why we want to measure certain metrics for our customer. Describe in detail 5 metrics to measure these SLIs. 

## Create a Dashboard to measure our SLIs
*TODO:* Create a dashboard to measure the uptime of the frontend and backend services We will also want to measure to measure 40x and 50x errors. Create a dashboard that show these values over a 24 hour period and take a screenshot.

## Tracing our Flask App
*TODO:*  We will create a Jaeger span to measure the processes on the backend. Once you fill in the span, provide a screenshot of it here. Also provide a (screenshot) sample Python file containing a trace and span code used to perform Jaeger traces on the backend service.

## Jaeger in Dashboards
*TODO:* Now that the trace is running, let's add the metric to our current Grafana dashboard. Once this is completed, provide a screenshot of it here.

## Report Error
*TODO:* Using the template below, write a trouble ticket for the developers, to explain the errors that you are seeing (400, 500, latency) and to let them know the file that is causing the issue also include a screenshot of the tracer span to demonstrate how we can user a tracer to locate errors easily.

TROUBLE TICKET

Name:

Date:

Subject:

Affected Area:

Severity:

Description:


## Creating SLIs and SLOs
*TODO:* We want to create an SLO guaranteeing that our application has a 99.95% uptime per month. Name four SLIs that you would use to measure the success of this SLO.

## Building KPIs for our plan
*TODO*: Now that we have our SLIs and SLOs, create a list of 2-3 KPIs to accurately measure these metrics as well as a description of why those KPIs were chosen. We will make a dashboard for this, but first write them down here.

## Final Dashboard
*TODO*: Create a Dashboard containing graphs that capture all the metrics of your KPIs and adequately representing your SLIs and SLOs. Include a screenshot of the dashboard here, and write a text description of what graphs are represented in the dashboard.
